An in-browser stop-frame animation package

Started because my son is into stop-frame animation and there actually isn't a lot
of simple software out there. We were using toonloop on Linux and I was curious how far
one could get using built-in browser features, specifically the webcam support. It was
also an angularjs learning project.

I was pleased with the result:
- Very usable to create simple stop-frame animations
- Tile and preview mode
- Onion skinning
- Adjust frames per second (fps)
- Delete frames
- Export to MOV file
- Persist project to server
- No plugins required

Note: only tested in Chrome

Vague plan is to host it somewhere and allow anyone to register to create animations, and
keep for 24hrs to keep storage requirements low.
